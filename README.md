# Enterprise Advisory Group

The Enterprise Advisory Group consists of corporate representatives in leadership roles responsible for managing for large-scale deployments of Node.js in an Enterprise environment. We strive to provide timely feedback to the [TSC](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC), the [CommComm](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee), the [Node.js project](https://github.com/nodejs/node) and the Node.js Foundation about the needs of Node.js Enterprise users.

This group is a part of the [Node.js End User Feedback Inititative](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback) which is under the charter of the [Node.js Community Committee (CommComm)](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee). Thank you for your interest and support. Please [create an issue](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback/issues) in this repo if you are interested in dedicating 5+ hours a month to during the formation process.

### Governance and Contributing
The Enterprise Advisory Group has adopted the core governance and contributing policies of Node.js. This group is a part of the [Node.js End User Feedback Inititative](https://github.com/nodejs/user-feedback) which is under the charter of the [Node.js Community Committee (CommComm)](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee).

Members are expected to be able to provide feedback on proposed changes in the Node.js project and gather input on how those changes will impact teams, business goals and application performance at scale and in the Enterprise context. Members are expected to attend regular advisory meetings to provide feedback and respond to occational outreach requests.
